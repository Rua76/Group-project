Long long ago, there is a peaceful village at the border of a country. Everyone lives here happily. 

However, one day, some werewolves entered the village. They pretend to be normal villagers during daytime, but once the sun falls, they come out to kill people living here. 

People are afraid, so they decide to have a morning meeting everyday. During the meeting, they figure out who was killed last night, and vote out a villager who is most likely to be a werewolf. 

Besides, there are four villager that have special abilities, and they will utilize their ability to protect others. 

Will you be a villager and survive from killing, or be a werewolf and turn the small village into a hell......
