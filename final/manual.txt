There will be 12 players in one game, 4 werewolves, 4 normal villager, and 4 special villagers (or "gods" in short).

Normal villagers do not have any action in the night. They just sleep to the morning and attend morning meeting held everyday and vote out a suspected villager.

Werewolves can open eyes at night and check their teammates, then choose a target to kill tonight. During daytime, they act just like normal villagers to hide themselves.

Seer can open eyes at night, and she can confirm a chosen villager's status. Is s/he a "good people" (normal villagers or gods), or a "bad" one (werewolf)? In the daytime, you can choose to reveal your identity to let others vote the one you choose, but this also expose you in danger. Be careful!

Witch have one lotion to heal, and one poison to kill. She can open eyes at night, and she will be told who was killed tonight. She may choose to rescue or not. Also, she get a chance to kill one villager with her poison. In the daytime, you can choose to reveal your identity to let others vote the one you choose, but this also expose you in danger. Be careful!

Guard can protect a villager each night, the one been protected will not be killed.

Hunter have a gun, and once he was killed in the night, he can choose a villager to die together.

Werewolves win if 4 normal villagers OR 4 gods were killed, good people (villagers + gods) win if all 4 werewolves are killed. 

Good luck!
